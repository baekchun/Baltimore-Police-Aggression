        Does BPD's aggressive policing affect people's view on local govt?

     <b>Preface:</b> In 2014, faculty from UC Berkeley and Yale published a study, investigating whether New York's stop-and-frisk practices might affect the likelihood of calling 311 in different communities. The authors concluded that intrusive policing made people less likely to reach out to city govt.<br>
     <br> <b>Goal:</b> I looked for a correlation between BPD's use of force data and 311 service calls made in 2015. Since Baltimore Police Department did not release detailed information on the police stops  they made, I used BPD's data on police use of force incidents that were investigated by the BPD Force Investigation Team instead.</br>
     <br><em><b>Note:</b> Heatmap is the map of data points of total 311 service calls made. Markers are the data points of where BPD's use of force incidents took place. </br>
