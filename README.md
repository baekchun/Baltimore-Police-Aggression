## Introduction

This project is aimed to find a relationship between Baltimore Police Department's use of force to contain a situation and people's faith in local city government. It was inspired by a study in 2014 done by faculty from UC Berkeley and Yale who found a positive correlation between NYPD's stop and frisk practices and the likelihood of calling 311 services. 

## Getting started

### Setup

There aren't any prerequisites for the setup. Simply open index.html file on Chrome or any other brower. 

### How to use

Use the dropdown menu to select the type of BPD's use of force and you can use the two autocomplete search boxes for 311 service calls. The top search box can be used to find the number of calls made in any neighborhood and the bottom search box can be used to find the type of 311 calls made in Baltimore. If you'd like to view all the 311 calls, search "View all"
